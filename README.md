#Description:
This is a bank system simulation. A client can log into their profile to open/close unlimited number of accounts and transact on them. A manager can search for any customer in the bank and has all the capabilities of a client plus the ability to open loans and set overdraft. A maintenance worker is authorized to set a flag that will instruct the system to trace users by writing details in a log.txt file.
